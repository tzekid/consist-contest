    <h2 id="what-is-splunk">What is Splunk</h2>
    <p>To summarize what Splunk is without watering down all the awesome stuff it can do, you can think of it like this:
      “It’s like Google for all kinds of machine data!”</p>
    <p>Every company has a gazillion applications and servers, databases and network devices like routers - and all of
      them create log files that record their activities and statuses over time. Troubleshooting a single problem in
      this sea of machine data, or monitoring their status would be a pain to do manually!</p>
    <p>That’s where Splunk comes in and collects all this machine data in one place making it easy to search and
      investigate data, just like Google does for the web!</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-install-splunk">How to install Splunk</h2>
    <p>Before doing anything you have to install Splunk. To do that, you have to go on their page and <a
        href="https://www.splunk.com/page/sign_up?redirecturl=https://hackathon.consist.de">create a new account</a>.
      After you’ve done that, log in and <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html">download
        their client</a> on the platform of your choice. For more instructions on that, have a look at <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Chooseyourplatform">the official
        docs</a>.</p>
    <p>After you’ve successfully installed it, open your browser and enter <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> in the
      URL bar.</p>
    <p>There you can enter your Splunk login credentials<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Once logged in click on the “Search &amp; Reporting” app on the bar on the
      left.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./aa182b9f-a631-4457-91ee-471f953cc815.png" alt="" />
      <figcaption>You should get something like this.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="getting-data-into-splunk">Getting Data into Splunk</h2>
    <p>Now, the search view is empty because there’s no data. So let’s import some.</p>
    <p>In the upper left corner, click on the Splunk logo. That will take you to the home screen. From here, click on
      “Add Data”.</p>
    <p>In this screen you have multiple options of how to get data into Splunk. All we want for now is to upload a set
      of data. Click on the Upload button.</p>
    <p>Once there, you can download <a href="#">this dataset</a> and upload it to Splunk by either drag and dropping it
      there or selecting it with “Select File”. Splunk can handle many different data types, but in our case it is
      already in the format we want so you’ll just have to click “next” in every set up screen. Once done, click on
      “Start searching”, which will take you back to the search app.</p>
    <h2 id="the-splunkweb-interface">The SplunkWeb Interface</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src="./dindindin.png" alt="" />
      <figcaption>This is should see</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This is the place you’ll be spending most of your time. You already have an initial search command which shows
      you only the data you’ve imported.</p>
    <p>The search command is written in the <strong>Search Processing Language (SPL)</strong>. All your searches are
      based around two factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>finding and filtering the data to include only the events you’re looking for</li>
      <li>selecting the appropriate time range the events occured in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the left panel you can see fields that Splunk has recognise`d under <strong>IMPORTANT FIELDS</strong>.</p>
    <p>Clicking on the <strong>status</strong> field shows you exactly which status codes and how often they show up in
      the dataset, giving up very powerful information - how the server performs - at a glance. There you also find a
      couple of quick useful searches under <strong>Reports</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="the-spl-language">The SPL language</h2>
    <p>A splunk search is a series of commands and arguments chained together using the pipe character (<code>|</code>)
      such that the output of one command is fed into the next command to the right.</p>
    <p>In abstract it looks somewhat like this:</p>
    <pre class="spl"><code>index=&lt;index&gt; &lt;filter&gt; &lt;&quot;text string to match&quot;&gt; 
| command1 &lt;arguments&gt; 
| command2 &lt;arguments&gt; 
| visualization commands &amp; arguments</code></pre>
    <p>Newlines are inserted by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> simultaniously.</p>
    <p>Effective searches can be created by following some basic steps, by building search commands progressively and
      iteratively, always making sure that you get the results you expect and understanding what each command does.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of resources to go through if you don’t know how a command works, like the Splunk <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon">(sp)lexicon</a> or <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation">docs</a> or <a
        href="https://answers.splunk.com/index.html">answers</a> or look it up on <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/splunk">StackOverflow</a>. Review the examples given and
      experiment with the command until you are confident in using it yourself.</p>
    <p>Here are the basic steps to building a SPL search string:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Specify an index and time range that will retrieve all of the events you’re interested in.</li>
      <li>Add filters to better specify and reduce the number of events to just those you want to work with, and
        eliminate the rest.</li>
      <li>Progressively pipe the events/data to the next command plus any applicable arguments and check that you get
        what you expected from each step.</li>
      <li>Pipe the final dataset to a table, chart, or time chart for visualization and adjust the visualisation
        settings.</li>
      <li>When the search is working as desired, save it to a report, dashboard panel, or alert as desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="search-filters">Search filters</h3>
    <p>Applying filters is essential in isolating the search results to just the events that interest you.</p>
    <p>You can search by keywords, text strings or simple logic statements. A statement that has all of these is:
      <code>"addtocart" AND status &gt;= 400</code></p>
    <p>There is an implied <code>AND</code> between all filter parts in a search command, so we could rewrite the
      previous one as: <code>"addtocart" status &gt;= 400</code>.</p>
    <p>This command shows all events that contain the text string “addtocart” and has a keyword “status” with a value
      bigger or equal to 400.</p>
    <p>You can also specify other logic tools like <code>OR</code> or <code>NOT</code> in your search filters, use
      parantheses for grouping or utilise <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Search/Wildcards">wildcards</a> (asterisks). Using
      <code>NOT</code> and wildcards a lot can be heavy and slow down your searches, so use them wisely.</p>
    <p>Here’s another example that uses all of these search tools:
      <code>sourcetype=*access* (status = 400 OR status = 404) NOT "addtocart"</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="search-commands">Search commands</h3>
    <p>There are two very important commands in SPL, <code>eval</code> and <code>stats</code>, but in this section we
      will only cover <code>stats</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>stats</code> command is used to perform statistical functions. Here are some examples with the
      fictional value of “time_traveled”:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr class="header">
          <th>Function</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><code>avg(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats avg(time_traveled) as average_travel_time</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><code>count(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats count(time_traveled) by time_traveled</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><code>max(x) / min(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats max(time_traveled) as longest_travel_time</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><code>sum(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats sum(time_traveled) as total_travel_time</code></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The returned value of these functions has the name given after the <code>as</code> keyword, like
      <code>average_travel_time</code> above. If there’s no <code>as</code> present, then the function name will be
      shown instead, like the <code>count(time_traveled)</code> above.</p>

    <p>Things that we did not cover in this article that you should definetly look up are ways to visualize your data
      and creating dashboards. Splunk has a <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Viz/Aboutthismanual">getting started article</a> for
      both these topics.</p>
    <p>The next best thing you can do is play around with the dataset you have previously downloaded. Or better yet, you
      can go to a site like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">kaggle</a> to find a dataset that you may like to
      Splunk.</p>
    <p>There is the <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchTutorial/WelcometotheSearchTutorial">official
        tutorial</a> for Splunk you can go through if you want to learn more and the book we highly recommend is <a
