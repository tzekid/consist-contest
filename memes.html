    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-splunk">What is Splunk</h2>
    <p>To summarize what Splunk is without watering down all the awesome stuff it can do, you can think of it like
      this:
      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like Google for all kinds of machine data!‚Äù</p>
    <p>Every company has a gazillion applications and servers, databases and network devices like routers - and
      all of
      them create log files that record their activities and statuses over time. Troubleshooting a single problem
      in
      this sea of machine data, or monitoring their status would be a pain to do manually!</p>
    <p>That‚Äôs where Splunk comes in and collects all this machine data in one place making it easy to search and
      investigate data, just like Google does for the web!</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-install-splunk">How to install Splunk</h2>
    <p>Before doing anything you have to install Splunk. To do that, you have to go on their page and <a
        href="https://www.splunk.com/page/sign_up?redirecturl=https://hackathon.consist.de">create a new
        account</a>.
      After you‚Äôve done that, log in and <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html">download
        their client</a> on the platform of your choice. For more instructions on that, have a look at <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Chooseyourplatform">the official
        docs</a>.</p>
    <p>After you‚Äôve successfully installed it, open your browser and enter <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> in
      the
      URL bar.</p>
    <p>There you can enter your Splunk login credentials<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Once logged in click on the ‚ÄúSearch &amp; Reporting‚Äù app on the bar
      on the
      left.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./aa182b9f-a631-4457-91ee-471f953cc815.png" alt="" />
      <figcaption>You should get something like this.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="getting-data-into-splunk">Getting Data into Splunk</h2>
    <p>Now, the search view is empty because there‚Äôs no data. So let‚Äôs import some.</p>
    <p>In the upper left corner, click on the Splunk logo. That will take you to the home screen. From here, click
      on
      ‚ÄúAdd Data‚Äù.</p>
    <p>In this screen you have multiple options of how to get data into Splunk. All we want for now is to upload a
      set
      of data. Click on the Upload button.</p>
    <p>Once there, you can download <a href="#">this dataset</a> and upload it to Splunk by either drag and
      dropping it
      there or selecting it with ‚ÄúSelect File‚Äù. Splunk can handle many different data types, but in our case it is
      already in the format we want so you‚Äôll just have to click ‚Äúnext‚Äù in every set up screen. Once done, click
      on
      ‚ÄúStart searching‚Äù, which will take you back to the search app.</p>
    <h2 id="the-splunkweb-interface">The SplunkWeb Interface</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src="./dindindin.png" alt="" />
      <figcaption>You should see something like this</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This is the place you‚Äôll be spending most of your time. You already have an initial search command which
      shows
      you only the data you‚Äôve imported.</p>
    <p>The search command is written in the <strong>Search Processing Language (SPL)</strong>. All your searches
      are
      based around two factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>finding and filtering the data to include only the events you‚Äôre looking for</li>
      <li>selecting the appropriate time range the events occured in.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
          role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the left panel you can see fields that Splunk has recognise`d under <strong>IMPORTANT FIELDS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Clicking on the <strong>status</strong> field shows you exactly which status codes and how often they show
      up in
      the dataset, giving up very powerful information - how the server performs - at a glance. There you also
      find a
      couple of quick useful searches under <strong>Reports</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="the-spl-language">The SPL language</h2>
    <p>A splunk search is a series of commands and arguments chained together using the pipe character
      (<code>|</code>)
      such that the output of one command is fed into the next command to the right.</p>
    <p>In abstract it looks somewhat like this:</p>
    <pre class="spl"><code>index=&lt;index&gt; &lt;filter&gt; &lt;&quot;text string to match&quot;&gt; 
| command1 &lt;arguments&gt; 
| command2 &lt;arguments&gt; 
| visualization commands &amp; arguments</code></pre>
    <p>Newlines are inserted by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> simultaniously.</p>
    <p>Effective searches can be created by following some basic steps, by building search commands progressively
      and
      iteratively, always making sure that you get the results you expect and understanding what each command
      does.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of resources to go through if you don‚Äôt know how a command works, like the Splunk <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon">(sp)lexicon</a> or <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation">docs</a> or <a
        href="https://answers.splunk.com/index.html">answers</a> or look it up on <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/splunk">StackOverflow</a>. Review the examples given and
      experiment with the command until you are confident in using it yourself.</p>
    <p>Here are the basic steps to building a SPL search string:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Specify an index and time range that will retrieve all of the events you‚Äôre interested in.</li>
      <li>Add filters to better specify and reduce the number of events to just those you want to work with, and
        eliminate the rest.</li>
      <li>Progressively pipe the events/data to the next command plus any applicable arguments and check that you
        get
        what you expected from each step.</li>
      <li>Pipe the final dataset to a table, chart, or time chart for visualization and adjust the visualisation
        settings.</li>
      <li>When the search is working as desired, save it to a report, dashboard panel, or alert as desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="search-filters">Search filters</h3>
    <p>Applying filters is essential in isolating the search results to just the events that interest you.</p>
    <p>You can search by keywords, text strings or simple logic statements. A statement that has all of these is:
      <code>"addtocart" AND status &gt;= 400</code></p>
    <p>There is an implied <code>AND</code> between all filter parts in a search command, so we could rewrite the
      previous one as: <code>"addtocart" status &gt;= 400</code>.</p>
    <p>This command shows all events that contain the text string ‚Äúaddtocart‚Äù and has a keyword ‚Äústatus‚Äù with a
      value
      bigger or equal to 400.</p>
    <p>You can also specify other logic tools like <code>OR</code> or <code>NOT</code> in your search filters, use
      parantheses for grouping or utilise <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Search/Wildcards">wildcards</a> (asterisks).
      Using
      <code>NOT</code> and wildcards a lot can be heavy and slow down your searches, so use them wisely.</p>
    <p>Here‚Äôs another example that uses all of these search tools:
      <code>sourcetype=*access* (status = 400 OR status = 404) NOT "addtocart"</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="search-commands">Search commands</h3>
    <p>There are two very important commands in SPL, <code>eval</code> and <code>stats</code>, but in this section
      we
      will only cover <code>stats</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>stats</code> command is used to perform statistical functions. Here are some examples with the
      fictive
      value of ‚Äútime_traveled‚Äù:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr class="header">
          <th>Function</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><code>avg(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats avg(time_traveled) as average_travel_time</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><code>count(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats count(time_traveled) by time_traveled</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><code>max(x) / min(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats max(time_traveled) as longest_travel_time</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><code>sum(x)</code></td>
          <td><code>stats sum(time_traveled) as total_travel_time</code></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The returned value of these functions has the name given after the <code>as</code> keyword, like
      <code>average_travel_time</code> above. If there‚Äôs no <code>as</code> present, then the function name will
      be
      shown instead, like the <code>count(time_traveled)</code> above.</p>
    <p>You can get more info on <a
        href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/Eval">Eval</a> and <a
        href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/Stats">Stats</a> in the official
      documentation.</p>
    <h2 id="visualizing-searches">Visualizing Searches</h2>
    <p>At this point you can build simple searches, now how about visualizing them?</p>
    <h3 id="table">table</h3>
    <p>You can pipe events into <code>table</code> and get the event fields arranged from left to right.</p>
    <p>In the next example we take all events (<code>*</code>) and pipe them to table with:
      <code>* | table *</code></p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./visualizing_searches.png" alt="" />
      <!-- <figcaption>Screenshot_20190709_141951</figcaption> -->
    </figure>
    <h3 id="chart">chart</h3>
    <p>You can prepare the results to be displayed in a chart (bar, column, line, area or pie chart) with the
      <code>chart</code> command.</p>
    <p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.95em"><code>... | chart &lt;chart-options&gt; &lt;stats or aggregation function&gt; BY &lt;column-split&gt;

or

... | chart &lt;stats or agg function&gt; OVER &lt;row-split&gt; BY &lt;column-split&gt;</code></p>
    <p>And here‚Äôs a simple example where we count the useragents (e.g.¬†types of browsers) that visited our servers
      in
      the sample data with: <code>* | chart limit=3 count by useragent</code></p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./chart.png" alt="" />
      <!-- <figcaption>Screenshot_20190709_145831</figcaption> -->
    </figure>
    <h3 id="timechart">timechart</h3>
    <p><code>timechart</code> looks at a field (it‚Äôs values shown on the Y-axis) and how it changes over time
      (shown
      over the X-axis).</p>
    <p>Here‚Äôs an example using timechart to show the average data transmitted by different useragents:</p>
    <p><code>* | timechart avg(bytes) by useragent</code></p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./timechart.png" alt="" />
      <!-- <figcaption>Screenshot_20190709_142450</figcaption> -->
    </figure>
    <h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
    <p>Things that we did not cover in this article that you should definetly look up are ways to visualize your
      data
      and creating dashboards. Splunk has a <a
        href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Viz/Aboutthismanual">getting started article</a>
      for
      both these topics.</p>
    <p>The next best thing you can do is play around with the dataset you have previously downloaded. Or better
      yet, you
      can go to a site like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">kaggle</a> to find a dataset that you may
      like to
      Splunk.</p>
    <p>There is the <a
